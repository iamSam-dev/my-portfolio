# Sam

*IoT | Embedded Systems | VHDL | AI*

Welcome to my portfolio — a showcase of engineering projects blending innovation, embedded hardware, and emerging technologies. I specialize in building IoT and embedded systems that solve real-world problems, with a foundation in both hardware logic and intelligent software.

## About Me

I'm an aspiring engineer with hands-on experience in:
- *IoT development* using ESP8266, LoRa, and MQTT
- *Embedded C* and microcontroller-based systems
- *VHDL-based digital system design*
- *AI and data visualization tools*

I believe in learning by doing and turning ideas into functional, scalable prototypes.

## Projects

### [LoRaCare](https://github.com/1amSam-dev/LoRaCare)
A LoRa-based patient alert system that enables medical staff to respond instantly — even when they're far from the patient.

### [Smart Irrigation System](https://github.com/1amSam-dev/Smart-Irrigation)
An IoT-based solution using ESP8266 and Blynk to monitor and automate farm irrigation, reducing water waste.

### [Noise Pollution Monitor](https://github.com/1amSam-dev/NoisePollutionMonitor)
Monitors ambient noise using KY-038 sensor and OLED display; logs data wirelessly via Wi-Fi for smart urban planning.

### [FPGA Real-Time DSP](https://github.com/1amSam-dev/FPGA-DSP)
Audio signal processing system built on VHDL, capable of live signal filtering and analysis.
